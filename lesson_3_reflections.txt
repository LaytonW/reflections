When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When I'm working on a group project or I'm not using my own computer. Then I'd like to store the repository in the 
	cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because I usually do debug with or add new features to my local files. I absulotly 
	don't want my changes erased by Git auto-pulling.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?

	Forks are copies of repository/repositories on GitHub, with reference to the original 
	one/ones. Clones are copies of repository/repositories in local workspace. Branches 
	are different stages within a single repository. Forks are used when I want to derive 
	my own version of someone else's project. Clones are used to store the repository 
	locally. Branches are used when working as a group on different parts of a project or
	when adding potential features which I don't want to include in the official version 
	while developing.
