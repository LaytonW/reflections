When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When I'm working on a group project or I'm not using my own computer. Then I'd like to store the repository in the 
	cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because I usually do debug with or add new features to my local files. I absulotly 
	don't want my changes erased by Git auto-pulling.
