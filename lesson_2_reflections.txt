What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Make a directory called '.git/' in current directory. To store the commits and other 
	information about the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value 
do you think it offers?

	A staging area is like a temporary stage where you decide which file or files you want 
	to make into a commit. While the working directory contains all the files and the 
	repository contains only the commited ones. It allows you to choose and adjust files in 
	a commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	Add only related file changes (i.e., changes due to the same logical need) to the 
	staging area once.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? 
How would branches help?

	When I want to add some experimental features or to make another parallel version. 
	Branches can seperate versions and allow me to implement other versions without 
	affecting the master (i.e., main) version.
